### Me_irl

{{< figure src="/moi.png" class="photo" >}} 
I am currently doing an engineering degree in computer science, electronics and telecommunications in France in apprenticeship as an network engineer / SRE at a French cloud provider. I am currently living in Rennes, France. 

Actively involved in the Open Source and the associative sector, I write Golang and Python software, do network administration ([@AS213253](https://enpls.org)) and GNU/Linux system administration [@GnousEU](https://gnous.eu/) (and previously [@MilkyWan](https://milkywan.fr)).

### AS213253
AS213253 is a IPv6 only ASN that provides Internet connectivity to me and some _other people_. This allows me to improve my skills in OSPF6, BGP-4 and network administration in general.
I announce 1 /48 IPv6 block. I don't have upstreams behind tunnels. The network main P.O.P.s are in Dronten, NL and Paris, FR.
Anycasted DNS servers and a NAT64 runs on it.

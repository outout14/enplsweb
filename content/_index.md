### Me_irl

I am currently studying in Mathematics and Physics/Chemistry. I am currently living in Guadeloupe, France and speak French, Creole, English, Spanish and a little bit of German.

Actively involved in the Open Source and the associative sector, I write Golang and Python software, do network administration ([@AS213253](https://network.enpls.org)) and GNU/Linux system administration ([@GnousEU](https://gnous.eu/) & [@MilkyWan](https://milkywan.fr)).

### AS213253
AS213253 is a IPv6 only ASN that provides Internet connectivity to me and some _other people_. This allows me to improve my skills in OSPF6, BGP-4 and network administration in general.
I announce 3 /48 IPv6 blocks. I don't have upstreams behind tunnels. The network main P.O.P.s are in New Jersey, USA; Montreal, CA; Dronten, NL; Paris, FR.
Anycasted DNS servers and a NAT64 runs on it.
